# 🧼 Image Cleaning with OpenCV & NumPy

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating image cleaning techniques using Python's powerful OpenCV and NumPy libraries. The notebook walks through various pre-processing operations that are often essential in computer vision tasks like image enhancement, segmentation, and object detection.

## 📁 File

- `image_cleaning.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook demonstrating step-by-step image cleaning techniques.

## 🧰 Features

- Load and display images using OpenCV.
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Apply Gaussian blur and other smoothing techniques.
- Use morphological operations like erosion and dilation.
- Perform thresholding (Otsu’s method, adaptive thresholding).
- Remove noise and clean artifacts from scanned or degraded images.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
